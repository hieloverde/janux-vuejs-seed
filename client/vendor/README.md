- bootstrap-2.1.1.css: 
	included here because downloading it from bower downloads the .less files,
	which have to then be built with 'make', which beats the purpose of installing
	with bower

- ui-bootstrap-custom-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.js:
  included here because included it from the original 'mastering angular' app,
	needs to be updated to more recent version of ui-bootstrap

- entypo:
	not available via bower
