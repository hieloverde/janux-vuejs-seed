This directory contains configuration files for the server-side express application.  The
application uses the node 'config' package at 

    project: https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config
    docs:    http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest

In short, 'config' makes it possible to externalize the parameters that vary on a per-deployment
basis (production, staging, local, etc...), so that a custom configuration can be stored along with
the environment, and files under source-control do not have to be changed to fit an environment.

If you want to change values in your local configuration, simply copy 

    development-sample.js 
to
    development.js

and override any parameters in default.js that you want to customize.

To override the log4js configuration, you will need to pass the full log4js configuration.
